# Contact Me - Smartphone Design

A creative way to design the "Contact Me" section of a website, simulating a smartphone interface. The app icons serve as methods of contact, all within a responsive design featuring a live clock.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for various screen sizes.
- **App Icons**: Clickable app icons that link to contact methods such as email or social media.
- **Live Clock**: A real-time clock displayed in the status bar.

## Customization

- **Add New Apps**: Add new app items in the `app-grid` section of `index.html`. Use the same structure as existing app items.
- **Change Wallpaper**: Replace the `background-image` in the `.phone-screen` class in `style.css` by editing the CSS rule like this:
  ```css
  .phone-screen {
  	background-image: url('images/your-wallpaper.jpg');
  }
  ```
  Alternatively, replace `wallpaper.webp` in the `images` folder with your own image, ensuring the file name matches the one used in the CSS.
